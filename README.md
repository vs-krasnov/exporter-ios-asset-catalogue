# iOS Catalogue Asset Exporter

The iOS Catalogue Asset exporter allows you to **export a XCode asset catalogue** in such a way that it can be immediately used in your production codebase. 

### Exporter Output

This exporter will render image assets defined inside one specific brand as pdfs and will produce the following structure:

```
/Icons
   /Top Menu
      |- Burger [pdf, preserve vector data]
      |- User [pdf, preserve vector data]
```

### Naming

The names of icons will be constructed from the original name and path built from segments which correspond to groups the Supernova (and Figma) groups. This exporter also generates required `Contents.json` files for each asset. For example:

```
Icons
  |- Top Menu
     |- Burger
     |- User
```

Names follow `Original Icon Name` convention and will create separate directories for each group detected, also following `Original Directory` convention. The above example will be converted to the following icon paths:

```
Assets.xcassets/Icons/Top Menu/Burger.pdf
Assets.xcassets/Icons/Top Menu/User.pdf

& Support files
Assets.xcassets/Icons/Top Menu/Contents.json
Assets.xcassets/Icons/Top Menu/Contents.json
```

This behavior can be fully customized by simply modifying the path generation template file `asset_path.pr` and additionally modifying configuration for each of the images in `asset_jsons.pr`. Simply fork, modify and upload as your version of the exporter. If you have never done this before, [follow our guide to modifying existing exporters](https://developers.supernova.io/building-exporters/cloning-exporters).
